<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Prabesh Niroula—a curious mind with a gym bag in one hand and a laptop in the other.
  Whether I'm fine-tuning an IoT project, writing technical blogs, or figuring out how to connect a servo motor to a fish feeder, I love turning ideas into something useful.
  My days start with cold showers and end with clean floors, but in between, I dive deep into data, guitar theory, and marketing strategies.
  I believe life's too short to do things that don't light a spark, so I'm building a path that combines creativity, tech, and a drive to keep learning.
  The goal? To turn knowledge into impact—and maybe a few affiliate commissions along the way.</p>
